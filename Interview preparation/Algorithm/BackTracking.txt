enumeration of limited results
and 
Tree shaped solution expansion, All answers are from root to leaves.

depth first search (iteration or recursive)

1 -> 4 -> 1
1 -> 4 -> 2
1 -> 5 -> 3
etc

procedure:

(1) draw the tree shaped solution expansion
(2) base cases
(3) transition function
	since solution is found at the position of leaves, the answer collection will be passed in the recursive function.
	eg: 	 public void backtrack(String digits, String prefix, List<String> ans)
		 public void backtrack(String prefix, int open, int close, int max, List<String> ans)
