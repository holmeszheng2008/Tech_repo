DP: recursion + 重复子问题
// Bottom-up dp problems sovling procedures
// 1. base cases.
// 2. transition funciton + condition + direction 
transition function to derive from base cases, moving from bottom-up. Direction shall be noticed. (condition may affect direction for edge spots)
// 3. tabulation.
tabulation by iteration from base cases through direction and fufill the matrix. Need to fill all the matrix to get result.

// Top-down dp problems sovling procedures
// 1. base cases
// 2. transition funciton + condition + direction 
transition function to derive from base cases, moving from bottom-up. Direction shall be noticed. (condition may affect direction for edge spots)
// 3. memoization
memoization (if not set, the object value is null). Written as recursion + memoization.
Know exactly where the result is in the matrix, then top down.
