In javascript:
	a && b doesn't have to return boolean
		They just follow the short circuit rule and execute in that order
	eg:
		true && b
			-> evaluates to b
		false && b
			-> evaluates to false
	
	a || b doesn't have to return boolean
	eg:
		true || b
			-> evaluates to true
		false || b
			-> evaluates to b
