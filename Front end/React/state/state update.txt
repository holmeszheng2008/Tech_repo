(1) When setSate is stacked and finally triggers the re-render, render() is called after that and component re-rendered.
(2) The sate is merged.
(3) In controlled components, the values of form elements are sync with form state. When setState called, the component is re-rendered and those form elements initialized using state. So we are not using HTML dom to controll respective states. The state in React is the only true source.
(4) each state indivisually is immutable, if you want to modify, re-create another one with spread operator ... or stringify?
(5) SyntheticEvent can't be saved in state. Pass constants needed inside syntheticEvent.
