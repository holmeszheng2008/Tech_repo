Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

1. named as use***
2. function component name must be uppercase
3. Only Call Hooks at the Top Level Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. cannot call use*** conditionally, by following this, hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders.
4. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. Instead, you can:
	Call Hooks from React function components.
	Call Hooks from custom Hooks
		# can't be used in class components functions as they are regular Javascript functions.
