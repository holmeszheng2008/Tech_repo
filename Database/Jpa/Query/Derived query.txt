JPA repository supports derived methods as below:
(1) find
	findBy, readBy, getBy, and queryBy (all behaves the same)
(2) count
	countBy
(3) delete
	deleteBy
	It will first fetch all related entities by findBy and then delete each of them by Id.
	So, this one will update the persistence context but the performance is bad.

@Query and @Modifing
As to Custom queries with @Query and @Modifing, update operations won't update the persistence context since hibernate won't be able to konw what entities are modified.
	So either manual detach is needed, or @Modifying(clearAutomatically, flushAutomatically) to clear all
