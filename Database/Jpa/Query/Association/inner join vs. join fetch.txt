(1) inner join, left join, right jion, full outer join
will join all the association tables, but only return the top element.

eg:

    select
        employee0_.id as id1_2_,
        employee0_.age as age2_2_,
        employee0_.department_id as departme7_2_,
        employee0_.first_name as first_na3_2_,
        employee0_.last_name as last_nam4_2_,
        employee0_.organization_id as organiza8_2_,
        employee0_.position as position5_2_,
        employee0_.salary as salary6_2_ 
    from
        world.employee employee0_ 
    left outer join
        world.department department1_ 
            on employee0_.department_id=department1_.id


(2) join fetch, left join fetch, right jion fetch, full join fetch
will join all the association tables, instantiate the associations as well along the way.

    select
        employee0_.id as id1_2_0_,
        department1_.id as id1_1_1_,
        employee0_.age as age2_2_0_,
        employee0_.department_id as departme7_2_0_,
        employee0_.first_name as first_na3_2_0_,
        employee0_.last_name as last_nam4_2_0_,
        employee0_.organization_id as organiza8_2_0_,
        employee0_.position as position5_2_0_,
        employee0_.salary as salary6_2_0_,
        department1_.name as name2_1_1_,
        department1_.organization_id as organiza3_1_1_ 
    from
        world.employee employee0_ full 
    outer join
        world.department department1_ 
            on employee0_.department_id=department1_.id


LOL: Mysql has no full outer join.
