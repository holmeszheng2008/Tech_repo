# Method reference
# Functional interface is actually an interface marked by @FunctionalInterface, which only has one fuction inside.
If that is functional interface, you can assign it as lambda. If you also need other properties inside or it's not a functional interface, then still go with the old fashion (instantiate an annonymous class).

They both are actually lambdas.
To know if they could fit into each other, just consider them all as the corresponding method signature.

For example:

(1) FunctionalInterface:
@FunctionalInterface
public interface BooleanSupplier {

    /**
     * Gets a result.
     *
     * @return a result
     */
    boolean getAsBoolean();
}

(2) Lambda
	() -> {return true;}
	() -> true;

(3)
public class Message {
	public static boolean isMessage(){
		return true;
	}
}
Message::isMessage

All three are equals to the method signature:
	boolean ()

# Method reference:

(1) Class::static_method
StringUtils::capitalize ->
String (String)

(2) object::instance_method
new Integer(1)::compareTo ->
Boolean (Integer)

(3) Class::instance_method
Integer::compareTo ->
Boolean (Integer, Integer)
	The first parameter will be the object "this" used for the instance_method

(4) Constructor method
	Class:new
	
	eg:
	class Message{
		Message (String) {
		
		}
	}
	
Message::new ->
Message (String)
